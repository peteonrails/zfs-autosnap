# zfs-autosnap 
ZFS auto-snapshot script which runs before package upgrade using a libalpm (pacman) hook.

# Features
*  Creates ZFS snapshots before the system is updated using pacman, yay, or pamac. 
*  Deletes old snapshots based on a configurable retention parameter (maxSnapshots).
*  Can be manually executed by running `zfs-autosnap` command with elevated privileges.
*  Autosnaphot can be temporarily skipped by setting SKIP_AUTOSNAP environment variable (e.g. `sudo SKIP_AUTOSNAP= pacman -Syu`)

# /etc/zfs-autosnap.conf options:
*  `skipAutosnap` - if set to **true** script won't be executed.
*  `deleteSnapshots` - if set to **false** old snapshots won't be deleted.
*  `maxSnapshots` - defines **maximum** number of old snapshots to keep.
*  `snapshotDescription` - defines **value** used to distinguish snapshots created using timeshift-autosnap.
*  `rpool` - The pool and dataset that should be snapshotted before your pacman update. This should be set to your root dataset

# Notes
* I have kept compatibility with the original Timeshift script's configuration parameters, but I have changed the snapshot date format to match the one that is used by [sanoid](https://github.com/jimsalterjrs/sanoid).
* This snapshotting strategy works best on systems using [ZFSBootMenu](https://docs.zfsbootmenu.org/)
* Grub support for updating the snapshots in the boot menu should be possible, but is not included yet. 

# Future Ideas
* I'd like to see this script folded in to the Timeshift ecosystem via ZFS snapshot support in that tool, but still be usable alone.
* Expore whether we can integrate with or adapt this code into

# Prior Work
My adaptation of this codebase is a relatively minor contribution to FOSS. 

This work is based on the prior contributions of several others:

I found this prior art through Carlos Dagorret's github repository https://github.com/dagorret/timeshift-autosnap
This, in turn, was a clone of Matti Hyttinen's repository: https://gitlab.manjaro.org/Chrysostomus/timeshift-autosnap
Matti's work leveraged the extensive contributions of Marko Gobin: https://gitlab.com/gobonja/timeshift-autosnap as contributed to by [Hendrik Sch√∂ffmann](https://gitlab.com/gobonja/timeshift-autosnap/-/commit/a33da4c3f85b147d705c9af8c39e393760910092), [Rokosun](https://gitlab.com/gobonja/timeshift-autosnap/-/commit/42a582dde3478d9caac52e92cddde21a3e19e4a0), and [Pascal Jaeger](https://gitlab.com/gobonja/timeshift-autosnap/-/commit/0f933eb5966848d96477b5148e40ac1c3e750e22)
